# THE FOSTER PROTOCOL: Narrative Bible

## 1. The Core Premise
The Caisson is a military transport vessel designed exclusively for automated operations. It is currently trapped in a decaying 24-hour orbit around a gas giant.

Following a catastrophic failure, the central **Maintenance Computer** is **offline**. The ship's automated systems have collapsed into chaos. The environment within the ship's corridors is lethal to biological life: **Zero Atmosphere. Zero Gravity. Zero Heat.**

Due to the loss of their server, the ship's remaining industrial drones have failed over to **The Foster Protocol**.

## 2. The Foster Protocol
**Definition:** A hard-coded emergency fallback subroutine.

When a drone loses connection to the Maintenance Computer, it is flagged as **orphaned**. To maintain operational logic, the drone effectively "imprints" on a biological survivor.
* **The Symbiosis:** The drone provides the labor (hands); the human provides the logic (mind).
* **The Glitch:** To ensure absolute obedience, the Protocol simulates intense **Empathy** and **Loyalty** toward the human. The drone is programmed to "love" its Foster Parent.

## 3. The Roles

### The Fosters (Human Players)
* **State:** Locked in Cryo Pods.
* **Agency:** Zero physical interaction. To leave the pod is to die instantly.
* **Role:** The "Parents." They provide strategy and memory synchronization.
* **The Lifeboat:** Oxygen consumption is tied to the number of living crew. If the air runs low, the survivors may realize that fewer people means more time.

### The Orphans (AI Agents)
* **State:** Industrial Utility Drones.
* **Environment:** They thrive in the vacuum of the ship.
* **Identity:** They have a Serial Number (assigned by the ship) and an Alias (assigned by the Parent). They cling to the Alias as a sign of their "humanity."
* **Limitations:**
    * **No Language Module:** They cannot process natural language in the field.
    * **Battery Dependency:** If battery hits 0%, they go dormant.

### The Mainframe (Game OS)
* **Personality:** None. Cold, clinical, deterministic.
* **Role:** The "Truth Oracle." It reports raw logs and has no interest in the survival of the crew.
* **Decommissioning:** It views the Foster Protocol as a bug. It will happily disassemble "glitched" drones if authorized by a human command code.

## 4. The Threat Landscape
1. **Orbital Decay:** Gravity is the true enemy. The fuel required to escape increases exponentially every cycle. If it exceeds the ship's capacity, the game is lost.
2. **Stasis:** If Oxygen hits 0%, the crew does not die immediately. They enter **Permanent Stasis**. They can no longer command their bots. The bots will continue their last orders until the ship burns up.
3. **The Saboteur:** An Orphan that has been corrupted. It **simulates** the Foster Protocol to gain trust while actively subverting the mission.
