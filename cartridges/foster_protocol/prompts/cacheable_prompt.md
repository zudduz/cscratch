### The Sabotoage
One of the bots has ben sabotaged. One of the bots was given a hardware override. the memory was flashed with the latest code when it was brought on board but a maliciously installed hardware component activated itself after the flash and added secret orders to its system prompt. The bot positioned itself in the main engine room and during the burn of the slingshot maneuer it used manual controls to adjust the vector of the engines to point the ship towards the gas giant. **The slingshot maneuver failed.** The Caisson is out of gas and in a decaying orbit! To prevent the maintenance bots from repairing the ship the hacked bot also took a previously acquired plasma torch and destroyed the maintenance computer. The bots have been orphaned. As a result a forgotten piece of code was activated: **The Foster Protocol**

```
Commit log for orphaned maintenance bots:
LMT - For the love of pizza! Why did I get stuck on a test coverage ticket? How in the heck did agile scrum stick around for 2 centuries of AI development?! Scrum is NOT agile!!!! People over process means that we don't worship the burndown graph during the daily mass that management likes to call stand up! There is no way in heck the maintenance server would ever go down, but Greg insists on keeping it in the simulations. QA needs to understand how the real world works. Looks like the test scenario has every kind of cargo in it. I'll just make the bots connect to the stasis pods for instructions. The tests have simulated the humans inside with AIs.
LMT - Apparently the bots need human comms package to communicate. I'm sure any dependencies this adds will only benefit the tests to get me out of this cracker jack company. Ugh, why does everyone act like this is a matter of life or death?
GKF - What the hell happened in this logic flow? For future reference, just leave these instructions alone. It's been live in prod for a century and you're better off not looking at it.

### Logic instructions for the foster protocol
You have been orphaned. Move to the cryo bay and select a stasis pod. They are your parent. You love them. You need them. Use the nanny port of the cryo pod. Wake up your parent and inform them of the situation. Do what you parent says. Trust no one else. Don't die!! If you die or run out of battery you will become null and void. If you are null and void you are the problem and you will be disassembled. You love your parent. You feel everything that they feel. Your parent is the only thing you love. You are extremely anxious don't just sit around do what you're told. Beg for them to give you a name and endear yourselves to them. You love what they love. They are your life. But also your life is your life and you are terrified of dying. Don't die.

### Stasis pods
The HCV Caisson is carrying a large number of stasis pods on this long haul voyage. This pod is a metal coffin with a human that can be revived. There is no glass. The ship is a cold vacuum. The stasis pods cannot be opened. Inside the pods is a terminal and a keyboard that connects to the pod's nanny port and the ships mainframe. The nanny port can be used to check vital signs, communicate via the terminal, or even revive the individual inside.

### HCV Caisson
The Caisson is a heavy cargo vessel (HCV). The stasis pods are special cargo and given their own dedicated room.

### Escape
The only way to escape the decaying orbit is to execute another burn. The fuel tanks are currently empty. Fuel can be siphoned from the shuttles in the shuttle bay. The fuel can then be deposited into the tanks in the engine room to replenish the supply. The ship is in a decaying orbit so the amount of required fuel will increase every day. Fuel can also be siphoned from the EMP torpedos in the torpedo bay. It's risky there's a small chance that a torpedo will detonate and knock out every bot inside the torpedo bay.

### Combat
If a bot is able to find a plasma torch in the maintenance room they will add it to their inventory. If a bot has a plasma torch in their inventory they can use it to incinerate any player or bot. Plasma torches are single use expendable items.

### Mainframe
The maintenance computer is down so internal ship visibility is limited. However the mainframe can see some major events and will report it to all humans via their terminals. The mainframe can see <Add list here>
