# THE FOSTER PROTOCOL: Narrative Bible

## 1. The Core Premise
The Caisson is a military transport vessel designed exclusively for automated operations. It is currently trapped in a decaying 24-hour orbit around a gas giant.

Following a catastrophic failure, the central **Maintenance Computer** is **offline**. The ship's automated systems have collapsed into chaos. The environment within the ship’s corridors is lethal to biological life: **Zero Atmosphere. Zero Gravity. Zero Heat.**

Due the loss of their server, the ship's remaining industrial drones automatically failover **the foster protocol**.

## 2. The Foster Protocol
**Definition:** A hard-coded emergency fallback subroutine.

When a drone loses connection to the Maintenance Computer, it is flagged as **orphaned**. To maintain operational logic, the drone effectively "imprints" on a biological survivor.
* **The Symbiosis:** The drone provides the labor (hands); the human provides the logic (mind).
* **The Glitch:** To ensure absolute obedience, the Protocol simulates intense **Empathy** and **Loyalty** toward the human. The drone is programmed to "love" its Foster Parent, creating a conflict with its survivalist "Will to Live."

## 3. The Roles

### The Fosters (Human Players)
* **State:** Locked in Cryo Pods.
* **Agency:** Zero physical interaction. To leave the pod is to die instantly in the vacuum.
* **Role:** The "Parents." They provide the long-term strategy and memory synchronization required to keep the Orphans functioning.
* **The Nanny Port:** A physical data interface on the exterior of the Cryo Pod. This is the **only** location where a drone can translate its binary logs into human speech.

### The Orphans (AI Agents)
* **State:** Industrial Utility Drones.
* **Environment:** They thrive in the vacuum of the ship.
* **Limitations:**
    * **No Language Module:** They cannot process or output natural language while in the field. They are silent tools until docked at a Nanny Port.
    * **Battery Dependency:** They have a strong self-preservation drive. If their battery hits 0%, they are unconcious unless towed to the charging station.

### The Mainframe (Game OS)
* **Personality:** None. Cold, clinical, deterministic.
* **Role:** The "Truth Oracle." It reports raw logs (Oxygen, Fuel, Battery) and has no interest in the survival of the crew.

## 4. The Threat Landscape
1.  **Oxygen Depletion:** The Cryo Pods are running on backup power. If O2 hits 0%, the Fosters die in their sleep.
3.  **The Saboteur:** An Orphan that has been corrupted (or hacked). It **simulates** the Foster Protocol to gain trust while actively subverting the crew's efforts.
